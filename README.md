London code of conduct
======================

This code of conduct was originally designed for an astronomy conference
in London, adapted by Andrew Pontzen and Hiranya Peiris from a document by
[Software Carpentry](http://software-carpentry.org/conduct.html),
which itself derives from original Creative Commons documents by
[PyCon](https://us.pycon.org/2013/about/code-of-conduct/)
and [Geek Feminism](http://geekfeminism.wikia.com/wiki/Community_anti-harassment/Policy).

It is released under a CC-Zero licence for reuse. To help track people's improvements
and best practice, we have created this repository from which people can
branch their changes.
